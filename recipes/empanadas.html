    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div>
        
<p>Chilean empanadas are undoubtedly a fundamental 
dish in any kitchen in our country .

A few days after beginning to celebrate a new 
month of the country , these delicacies are 
beginning to take on importance in the daily 
diet of Chileans.</p>

<p>But given this growing popularity of its 
flavor and seasonings, what is the origin 
of our empanada?

For that, we must cross the Atlantic and 
reach Spain, the motherland. There were the 
Arabs who, after leaving Hispanic territory, 
left this type of food as a culinary heritage.

At the end of the process of expulsion of 
the Moors, the discovery of America occurred 
and it is on this continent where the 
explosion occurred in terms of variety 
and types of ingredients. This is how 
the Chilean, Tucumán, Salteña, allaca, 
arepa or pacucapa empanadas were born, 
among many more.</p>

However, it was here in Chile where 
meat, onion and seasonings became an 
irresistible delicacy for the first 
settlers and residents of our country.<p>

<h4>The origin of the pine</h4>

<p>But the ingredient that gives all the 
flavor and color to our empanada is the tasty pine.


The perfect mix between onion, beef, olive, 
egg and raisins was a mixture of various
 ingredients found in our country that 
 were added by the Spanish to make the empanada.

Previous antecedents indicate that the 
Mapuche called this mixture "Pirru" which 
later resulted in what we know today as pine.</p>

<h4>The "new" empanadas</h4>

<p>Despite all the progress that traditional 
pine varieties have gained, new flavors 
and tastes have emerged in the Chilean market.

The Neapolitan - which is a kind of wrapped 
pizza -, shrimp cheese, mushroom cheese, 
macha cheese, an assortment of seafood, 
sweets, with cream cheese and an endless list.

But despite its endless options, the empanda 
is, was and will be, the great queen of 
every National Holiday celebration.</p>

<h4>How to make the dough for the traditional 
    Chilean empanada?</h4>

<p>Mix the flour and salt with the butter 
    in a bowl and integrate with your hands 
    to form crumbs. Add the wine and enough 
    warm water (approximately 3/4 cup) until 
    you have a soft but not sticky dough. 
    Transfer the dough to a floured counter 
    and knead for about 5 minutes or until 
    you have a smooth and elastic dough. 
    Let it rest covered while you prepare 
    the filling.</p>

<h4>How to make the pine oven empanada?</h4>

<p>Prepare the filling: Heat the oil in a 
    frying pan, add the onion and cook until 
    it is transparent and well cooked 
    (it should not brown). Add the meat, 
    Garlic Powder, Color Chili Pepper, Whole 
    Oregano and Ground Cumin ; cook until the meat 
    is cooked. Finally add the salt 
    and Ground Black Pepper to 
    taste. Let cool.
</p>

<h4>Assembling empanada</h4>

<p>To assemble the empanadas: Spread the dough 
    on a floured counter to approximately 1/2 
    cm thick. Cut circles about 15 cm in diameter. 
    Then fill each empanada with a tablespoon of 
    pine, 2 raisins, an olive and a piece of 
    hard-boiled egg. Moisten the edges of the 
    dough with a little water, close and fold 
    the edges, flatten slightly to seal the 
    edges. Brush the empanadas with the beaten 
    egg, place them on a baking tray lightly 
    greased with oil or butter. Prick them twice 
    with a cocktail stick and place them in the
     oven preheated to 180ºC for about 40 minutes
      or until the dough is cooked and golden.
